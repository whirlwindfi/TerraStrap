# TerraStrap
Bootstrap core for Whirlwind Finance's Terra ecosystem whirlwind core technology

Purpose: Private liquidity aggregation bridge across EVM and Relay-Chain tech stacks. Permissioned or Permissionless creation requirements allows for liquidty firehose for crypto-native purposes as well as satisfying a wide array of TradFi legal concerns via permissioned pools.

TODO:
  - Testnet launch
  - Test EVM bridge
    - Test L2 bridge (Arbitrum, Optimism, xDAI, Polygon)
  - Test Relay-chain assets
  - Implement Solana bridge
    - Given SOL speeds, there is significant liquidity rebalancing opportunities here that a platform-owned arbitrage engine could generate significant revenues
